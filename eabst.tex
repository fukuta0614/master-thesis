Along with the spread of digital pathology technology, 
many researches have been conducted to assist diagnosis of a pathologist using computational image analysis.
On the other hand, it is often necessary to construct large-scale labeled dataset to acquire a model that achieves high classification ccuracy.
Since training datasets in medical domain such as pathological images require highly specialized knowledge, 
it becomes a heavy burden to the doctor and the annotation cost is very high.
Therefore, in this research, we adopt active learning framework to alleviate this issue without sacrificing high accuracy.
Active Learning is a framework which annotates only the infomatvie samples from an unlabeled image sets which are likely to improve a model accuracy.
In addition to propose a method to apply active learning to pathological images, 
we propose a new method for applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to active learning.
We experimented on the large scale pathological image datasets and verified its effectiveness.
