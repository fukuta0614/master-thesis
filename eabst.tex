Along with the spread of digital pathology, many types of research have been conducted to support the diagnosis of a pathologist using computational image analysis.
Generally, it is often necessary to construct large-scale labeled dataset to acquire a model that achieves high classification accuracy.
However, the cost of preparing such dataset for pathological images is quite expensive.
To make annotations to medical images such as pathological images requires highly specialized knowledge 
and all the annotation work must be performed by a doctor.

Therefore, in this research, we aim to construct a system that acquires high accuracy model for pathological images while suppressing annotation cost.
For this approach, we adopt an Active Learning framework, which automatically select the informative samples from an unlabeled image set and request people to annotate.
In addition, as a new method for applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to active learning,
we propose Query-By-Dropout-Predictions (QBDP) that utilizes the disagreement degree of prediction of partial network sampled by Dropout.

As a result of the experiment, in general image dataset, we show that our method outperforms conventional method.
Furthermore, we applied proposed system to the large-scale pathological image dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness.
